#Project_1: HOSPITAL OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT ANALYSISâ€‹

About: The 'Hospital Operational Management Analysis' project integrates SQL and Power BI to analyze hospital data, improve decision-making, and optimize resource utilization. SQL was used to create the database, define attributes, and populate data. Key business insights, related to room utilization, revenue generation, and medicine patterns, were derived through queries. Power BI dashboards were developed to visualize trends, including patient room turnover, department revenues, and prescription distributions, offering actionable strategies to optimize operations, enhance billing processes, and improve patient satisfaction (business questions) to improve the hospital operational performance. This project showcases expertise in data modeling, SQL analysis, and impactful visualizations.
